      <h2>My Story</h2>
      <p>My passion for intelligence structuring was sparked by a moment that continues to shape my work. During my twins’ ultrasound, the appearance of the lambda (λ) symbol was not just a medical marker—it was a sign of structured emergence, a glimpse into the forces that guide both biological and artificial evolution. This experience led me to develop the Monad framework, a model that marries the principles of order and creative variability to redefine how intelligence evolves.</p>
      <p>I bring this deeply personal insight to every project, helping organizations break free from conventional limitations and harness the true potential of AI.</p>
